This activity was detected by the OPNsense-External firewall and is associated with rule ID 87702. The MITRE ATT&CK framework identifies this pattern as T1110\, which relates to Credential Access through Brute Force techniques. Immediate actions should include: 
1. Review the firewall logs for any further unusual activity from the source IP 192.168.30.196. 
2. Investigate other security devices' logs to correlate this event and check for potential breaches or attempts. 
3. Increase monitoring on the subnet 192.168.30.0/24 to detect any further anomalous activities. 
4. Conduct a vulnerability assessment on the affected subnet to identify and mitigate any security weaknesses.

This activity is associated with the agent labeled '(056) - DC' and is identified by the rule number 91809. The MITRE framework categorizes this behavior under ID T1140\, with the associated tactic being 'Defense Evasion' and the technique described as 'Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information'. Immediate actions required include: 1. Review and analyze the PowerShell script content for any malicious intent or unauthorized commands. 2. Trace the origin of the script execution to identify the user or process responsible. 3. Check for any other alerts or signs of compromise on the agent '(056) - DC' to assess the scope of the potential breach. 4. Implement stricter execution policies for scripts on critical systems to prevent similar incidents. 5. Update the security incident response team with findings and actions taken for further investigation and remediation.",False
